# VidCap

VidCap (Video Caption Editor) is a utility for quickly editing video captions when preparing a dataset for fine-tuning video models. It allows users to load a folder with videos, select a video for playback, and edit the corresponding caption text directly within the window. Multiple languages and themes are supported, and user settings are saved for convenience between sessions.
